Here’s a professional README.md file for your Rental Car System project hosted at: https://github.com/varu63/Rental-car-system

🚗 Rental Car System
This is a Java-based Rental Car Management System designed for managing car rentals, tracking customer bookings, and calculating charges. The system is intended for basic usage in a console environment and demonstrates core Java programming concepts like object-oriented design, arrays, control structures, and input/output.

📌 Features
Display available cars

Book a car by customer name

Return a car and calculate total charges

View all rented cars

Simple command-line interface

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Java (Core Java)

Environment: Console / Terminal

Tools: Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse), or javac and java commands
